Power Consumption Analysis
Abstract
This project analyzes a power consumption dataset containing various features related to electricity usage in households. The primary objective is to explore trends in power consumption, identify patterns over different time periods, and assess factors influencing energy use. By employing data visualization techniques and statistical analysis, we aim to provide insights that can contribute to energy efficiency strategies and informed decision-making in energy management.

About the Dataset
The input data for this project is a CSV file named power_consumption.csv, which contains the following columns:

Column Name	Description
id	Unique identifier for each record.
timestamp	Date and time of the recorded power consumption.
household_id	Unique identifier for the household.
power_consumed	Amount of power consumed (in kWh).
temperature	Ambient temperature (in degrees Celsius).
humidity	Humidity level (as a percentage).
day_of_week	Day of the week the reading was taken.
month	Month the reading was taken.
year	Year the reading was taken.
season	Season during which the reading was taken (e.g., winter, summer).
Output
The output of this project includes various visualizations derived from the analysis of the dataset:

Daily Power Consumption Trends: A line graph illustrating daily power consumption over a specified time period, highlighting peak usage times and overall trends.

Power Consumption by Season: A bar chart comparing average power consumption across different seasons, showing how seasonal variations affect energy use.

Correlation Between Temperature and Power Consumption: A scatter plot visualizing the relationship between ambient temperature and power consumption, to identify any significant trends.

Power Consumption Distribution: A histogram displaying the distribution of power consumption values, helping to understand the frequency of different levels of electricity usage.
